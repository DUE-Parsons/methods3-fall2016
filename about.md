Methods 3 in [Design and Urban Ecologies](http://sds.parsons.edu/designurbanecologies/) at [Parsons The New School for Design](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/) during the Fall 2016 session covered map-making using traditional desktop GIS tools ([QGIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/)) and online with [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/). A variety of data sources were explored, including the [US Census](http://factfinder.census.gov/), [open data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/) portals, and [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).

Students were asked to create final projects using techniques covered in the
course on a topic of interest, whether that interest was personal or for future
research. We're excited to share the end products with you, which explore a
diverse span of locations, topic areas, and mapping techniques.

If you have questions about the course please [contact the
instructor](mailto:ericb@newschool.edu).
